      <h3>📌 Designed for Families and Lawyers</h3>
      <p>Whether you're in crisis or standing by to help, this toolkit gives you a fast, private way to push back against unlawful detention and extrajudicial transfer. It's not legal advice. It's legal action, simplified.</p>

      <h3>🧭 How It Works</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Emergency Habeas Petition</strong> – A complete filing under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, asserting violations of constitutional rights and requesting immediate judicial review. Tailored to the facts you enter, including legal grounds and specific relief requested.</li>
        <li><strong>Declaration and Signature Page</strong> – A formal statement under penalty of perjury, required for the court to act on your filing.</li>
        <li><strong>Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) – If Needed</strong> – If your responses indicate risk of immediate transfer or disappearance, the toolkit will auto-generate a TRO draft. This provides the court with a ready-to-sign request to halt movement or removal pending review.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Instructions</strong> – Guidance on how and where to serve your filing, including contacts for the U.S. Attorney and Attorney General.</li>
        <li><strong>Filing Court Locator (Beta)</strong> – Enter a ZIP code to help identify the appropriate U.S. District Court and generate venue information.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>🧯 What If ICE Claims They’re Not a Citizen?</h3>
      <p>In rare but documented cases, U.S. citizens have been mistakenly or deliberately treated as non-citizens and placed in ICE detention. When this happens, they may be routed through immigration court (EOIR) instead of the U.S. District Court system — and denied access to constitutional rights.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>⚠️ If ICE refuses to acknowledge valid proof of citizenship, a habeas petition may still be filed.</li>
        <li>📎 Include documents such as a passport, birth certificate, or Certificate of Citizenship.</li>
        <li>📞 Consider calling the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/eoir" target="_blank">EOIR</a> or local immigration court only if the person is held in ICE custody — and always assert citizenship clearly and early.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you believe ICE is holding someone unlawfully based on disputed status, file the emergency habeas and note the mistaken identity or denial of recognition as part of your filing.</p>
