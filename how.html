      <h3>🧭 Our Legal Filing Flow</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Mock Legal Brief</strong> – A narrative summary of the situation, drafted in plain language.</li>
        <li><strong>Federal Habeas Petition</strong> – Formatted to federal court standards (default is SDNY, but easily adaptable).</li>
        <li><strong>Appellate Brief</strong> – If relief is denied, an appeal-ready draft is generated.</li>
        <li><strong>Standalone TRO</strong> – A time-sensitive request for emergency relief.</li>
        <li><strong>Proposed Order</strong> – A ready-to-sign document the judge can use to grant immediate protection.</li>
        <li><strong>Notice of Hearing</strong> – Formal notification to the relevant parties and court.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>⚙️ What the App Does</h3>
