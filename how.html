      <h3>📌 Designed for Families and Lawyers</h3>
      <p>Whether you're in crisis or standing by to help, this toolkit gives you a fast, private way to push back against unlawful detention and extrajudicial transfer. It's not legal advice. It's legal action, simplified.</p>
    </section>
   
      <h3>🧭 How It Works</h3>

<p>The HabeasNow Toolkit helps families and advocates rapidly generate emergency legal filings when someone has been detained without charges, especially if there’s a risk of secret transfer or disappearance.Here’s what the system creates:
</p>
<p><ol>
<li><strong>**Emergency Habeas Petition**</strong><br>
   - A complete filing under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, asserting violations of constitutional rights and requesting immediate judicial review.
   - Tailored to the facts you enter, including legal grounds and specific relief requested.
</li>
<li><strong> **Declaration and Signature Page**</strong><br>
   - A formal statement under penalty of perjury, required for the court to act on your filing.
</li>
<li><strong>**Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) – If Needed**</strong><br>
   - If your responses indicate risk of immediate transfer or disappearance, the toolkit will auto-generate a TRO draft.
   - This provides the court with a ready-to-sign request to halt movement or removal pending review.
</li>
<li><strong>**Service Instructions**</strong><br>
   - Guidance on how and where to serve your filing, including contacts for the U.S. Attorney and Attorney General.
</li>
<li><strong>**Filing Court Locator (Beta)**</strong><br>
   - Enter a ZIP code to help identify the appropriate U.S. District Court and generate venue information.
</li>
</ol></p>

I want to preserve this because we had thought the Full Habeas Workup was desirable....do we still?
