      <h2>Is someone being detained or transferred without due process?</h2>
      <p><strong>No government official—president, police officer, agent, or judge—stands above the Constitution. Due process is not a courtesy; it is the law.</strong>
Citizens or not. Ally or dissenter. Regardless of race, religion, political belief, gender, or creed. The law protects us all. 
<strong>HabeasNow helps you generate and file emergency legal petitions—like writs of habeas corpus and TROs—fast.</strong></p>
